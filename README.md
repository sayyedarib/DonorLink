## üß™ Prettier lint test and How to fix it?

Prettier is a code formatter that helps maintain consistent code style and formatting in your projects. It automatically analyzes your code and applies predefined formatting rules to ensure a standardized appearance.

Linting is the process of analyzing code for potential errors, bugs, and code style violations. It helps identify and highlight problematic code patterns, potential bugs, and adherence to coding standards.

`<b>`"Prettier lint test" `</b>` refers to running a linter (such as ESLint) with the Prettier plugin or rules enabled. It means checking your code for both linting errors and code formatting inconsistencies according to Prettier's rules.

To enable automatic code formatting upon saving in Visual Studio Code, you can install the Prettier extension. This extension ensures that your code is consistently formatted and adheres to the defined style guidelines. Once installed, Prettier will format your code automatically whenever you save a file.

In case you prefer not to install the Prettier extension, there are two helpful commands you can use:

1. `npx prettier --check .`.: This command checks your codebase for any formatting issues without making any changes. It identifies areas where the formatting may not align with the defined rules.
2. `npx prettier --write .` .: This command automatically fixes the formatting issues in your codebase. It applies the appropriate formatting changes to ensure consistency and adherence to the defined style guidelines.
   By utilizing these commands, you can easily verify the formatting of your codebase and address any inconsistencies or style violations, even without having the Prettier extension installed.
